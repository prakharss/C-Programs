Backtracking is an algorithmic paradigm that tries different solutions until finds a solution that “works”. 
Problems which are typically solved using backtracking technique have following property in common. 
These problems can only be solved by trying every possible configuration and each configuration is tried only once. 
A Naive solution for these problems is to try all configurations and output a configuration that follows given problem constraints. 
Backtracking works in an incremental way and is an optimization over the Naive solution where all possible configurations are generated.
