unordered/ordered map and complexities of their operations 
time complexity of different containers

IMP THINGS TO REMEMBER 
1)vector<int> vec(4,1) //vec of size 4 having all values equal to 1
2)iterator for deque exists
3)erase function is present for containers like map, set, vector
4)iterator don't exist for queue, stack and priority_queue
5)vector,map and set all have empty functions
6)by default priority queue is a max heap 
7)syntax for max heap is priority_queue<int> pq; and for min heap is priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int> > pq; 
8)set elements is only accessible using iterator but map elements can be accessed both by [] and iterator

we can also sort vector of vector
